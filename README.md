A bunch of simple bioinformatics tools.

The basic target of the project is to create a bunch of data integrity tools.
Data from different sources (public databases, web pages, files) are converted into one universal format - **Resource Description Framework** (RDF). Particularly RDF/XML.

The RDF format is the most universal format for data storing/serialisation and easy to consume by different third party tools.
